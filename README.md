# ðŸ’¬ ChatFlowUi

Welcome to the **ChatFlowUi** project! This initiative is specifically designed for developers who want to test and validate the logic of their LLM (Large Language Model) integrations rather than creating end-product solutions. Our goal is to streamline the development process, allowing you to focus on refining your logic and experimenting with various scenarios while we handle the presentation aspect.

**ChatFlowUi** provides a lightweight and flexible user interface that facilitates the quick configuration and connection with LLM backends. Whether you're designing complex interactions or simple question-answering workflows, ChatFlowUi enables you to efficiently conduct tests, troubleshoot, and optimize your LLM applications.
