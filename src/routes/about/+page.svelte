        Welcome to <b>OmniChatUi</b>, a flexible and universal chatbot interface
        tailored for developers. Our objective is to provide a
        developer-friendly frontend that integrates seamlessly with various AI
        backends, empowering you to deliver exceptional chatbot experiences with
        ease.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Our Motivation</h2>
    <p class="mb-8 text-lg">
        As the field of AI and chatbot development evolves at a rapid pace,
        developers need tools that can adapt and grow with their requirements.
        OmniChatUi originated as an internal prototype, inspired by the need for
        a versatile interface that simplifies AI backend integration. With a
        current focus on Spring AI, prompted by an upcoming talk on chatbots at
        a local meetup, we've also embraced the dominance of OpenAI's API. As a
        result, our platform supports both Spring AI's
        <code class="break-all"
            >org.springframework.ai.chat.model.ChatResponse</code
        >
        and the standardized OpenAI request format, allowing developers to utilize
        the service without needing a dedicated backend.<br /><br />Our mission
        is to empower developers by offering a streamlined yet powerful UI that
        can be easily customized and extended to cater to individual needs.
